# LeetCode-NoteBook-Python3


## Goal
Although the Notebook contains a bunch of problem solutions, we demand more. 
The notebook aims at helping us become skilled at solving problems using *Data structures*, *Algorithms* and tricks properly.
Most problems will be hard with hands dirty if one uses "Brute Force", 
but if we work on them with proper *Data structures*, *Algorithms* and tricks,
the life will become quite easy as well as with a high quality yield.
Instead of through hard working on problems again and again,
our motivation is to develop problem-solving skills wisely 
by applying and deveoping meta-skills such as abstracting, grouping, finding properties, connecting, comparing, evaluating, etc..
(Sounds like working with *Category Theory*, doesn't it?)
Parallelly, there will be a collection of common procedures and steps, guidelines and tips available.

Furthermore, through this project, 
we hope to collect and develop (usually by abstracting) strategy 
for developing meta-skills 
useful in developing problem-solving skills.
They can be viewed layer by layer vertically.
And horizontally, we need to supply common procedures and steps, guidelines and tips by abstracting.
These abilities and the strategy are common in other domains of materials.
The higher demand will motivate us through the journey.


## How to use LeetCode
Therefore,
*LeetCode* problems are no more isolated individual problems,
but a repository of problems with hidden connections of similarity and variance.
We need to manage time wisely instead of hacking on everyone starting from problem #1 which is frustrating.
Note *LeetCode* is NOT the place for learning fundamental concepts, we should do that before starting *LeetCode*.
The repository are trainings for developing individual skills
and also for applying them flexibly and logically.
Moreover, the problems are putting together for abstracting the common procedures and steps for solving problems.

Although it will be slower at the beginning,
but it will become much faster at the end with additional gain of higher level abilities.


## Map
The knowledges are organized in groups of "Analysis-Solutions", "Algorithms" and "Data-structures".
More than a structure, 
with time passing, we should have a virtual map in our brain for contents as nodes and connections as pathes.
That is, *LeetCode* problems are no more in a linearly ordered sequence,
but a graph of nodes and connections.


## Schedule 
- One month on "Easy" questions:
They provide us the chance for understanding and getting familiar with concepts and properties.
They are for developing individual basic skills and tricks for the future.
They are the starting point of the journey for expanding our power. 
But we do not have to go through all of them, 
since many of them are not worth spending much efforts (See [Tips](#tips)).
Therefore we start with questions for fundamental concepts and skills.
And then make sure to cover all "Top 100 Liked Questions" and "Top 100 Interview Questions".
At this time, we focus on implementation skills.

- Then one "Medium-Hard" problem per day:
They are essential problems closer to real daily problems.
They are more complexed problems composed of lower level problems with new restrictions,
which require us to play with a bunch of basic building blocks flexibly and logically.
Make sure to cover all "Top 100 Liked Questions" and "Top 100 Interview Questions".
At this time, we focus on solutions skills.


## Time Management
Only spend less than 20-30 minutes for generating a solution without implementation.
See "How to come up with own solutions".

On one hand, 
it trains us to get used to the real interview scene.

On the other hand, 
remember our goal is to get the problem-solving ability through the training.
Our time is valuable, we have to spend our time wisely.
We do not have to beat every question by our own during the training. 
No one knows everything when he is growing.
The failure guides us to the next success by showing what knowledge do we need to make up, 
and what skills do we need to spend our time for.
See "How to check with other solutions".


## How to come up with own solutions
* Grab a piece of white paper.
* 90-10 stratege: 90% time for thinking, 10% time for coding.
* Read the description carefully.
* Find and write down *input-output-functionality*, know what is the data structure for input.
* Find and write down restrictions.
* Abstract tasks and information to higher level as a conceptuality.
* Determine which group it belongs to.
* Connect to *Data Structures*, *Algorithms* and tricks commonly used for the group and estimate if they help to make the tasks easier.
* Manipulate this optional solution with a general example to make sure it works.
* Find other solutions and repeat above steps, and then estimate their *time / space complexity*.
* Pick one solution and decompose the tasks into sub-tasks according to your chosen tools and mark them down.
* Move on to "How to implement your own solutions".


## How to implement your own solutions
* Never start before coming up with own solutions.
* Open a notebook to write it down. It is where we make our hands dirty dealing with details.
* Bottom-up refinement with an example.
* Start with output or return, place them at different locations.
* Around return output to add code blocks for it and comment briefly for how to come up with the return.
* Structure the blocks by cases or loops and comment briefly for each one.
* Add initializations.
* Add *guards*.
* Double check with the *margin cases*.
* Verify by drawing test cases and manipulating them with our code. Modify the code to handle the error.
* Use compiler knowledge on codes for possible optimization. 
* Optimize (make concise) our codes by combining redundant, but sometimes it reduces readibility.
* Move on to "After implementation".


## After implementation
- #### Copy it to *LeetCode* and submit.
- #### Record bugs you couldn't find and do reasoning.
- #### Check with otherones answers for improvements.
- #### Move on to "How to check with other solutions".


## How to check with other solutions
- #### Benefit to check with standard solutions and also those in "Discuss" (click "Most Votes" and only for <=2 pages).
- #### Use "Debugger" to understand the solution step by step if necessary.
- #### Abstract their tricks and find out how to come up with the tricks from the questions, then extend our tricks set for this topic.
- #### Evaluate and compare *time / space complexity* of all solutions.
- #### Mark the problem number down and review it in the near future.


## Tips
* Use filters. E.g., pick "Top 100 Liked Questions".
* Do not work on the problems with :-1: >> :+1:. It doesn't mean the problem is "bad", but it is too easy if you have worked out "T-I".
* Only view discussion with :+1: >> :-1:.
* Do not connect the problem to a particular problem, but to a general category, because we have limited memory.
* Optimization and conciseness are different.
* Understand the relationship of *Data Structures*, i.e., *Hash Table* with don't care values, then use *Set*.
* Keep in mind the operations can be arranged in different structures, by trade off between readibility and conciseness.
* Conciseness might not always help optimization (which is by estimating complexity and mind-compiling), but reduce readability.
* We will be skilled at conciseness automatically with the time going, but focus on correctness and *time / space complexity*.
* Do not RUSH! The faster is the slower; The slower is the faster.
* Instead of hacking on solving problems, it benefits from reviewing sloved problems as well as other people's solutions.

*Note we supply solutions as much as possible for inspiration, 
but please estimate if it satisfies the question restrictions.*
